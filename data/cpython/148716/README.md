# Assertion 'probable_callable != NULL' in optimize_uops when sys.settrace is set and cleared before a type-unstable method call loop crosses the JIT threshold

## Description

# Crash report

### What happened?

**Description**

CPython's JIT optimizer crashes with an assertion failure `probable_callable != NULL` in `optimize_uops` (`Python/optimizer_cases.c.h:4307`) when a tracing function is installed and immediately removed via `sys.settrace`, followed by a loop that calls a method on type-unstable objects enough times to cross the JIT compilation threshold. The optimizer fails to find a non-null callable when processing a `CALL` uop whose receiver type varies across iterations, causing the assertion to fire.

**Reproducer**

```python
import sys

D = True
A = True

class Tracer:
    def trace(self, frame, event, arg):
        return self.trace

sys.settrace(Tracer().trace)
sys.settrace(None)

class Cls:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
    def method(self, x):
        return self.val

for i in range(200):
    try:
        o = Cls(D) if i % 3 == 0 else (int(A or 0) if i % 3 == 1 else str(A or ''))
        o.method(D) if hasattr(o, 'method') else str(o)
    except Exception:
        pass
```

**Command**

```
PYTHON_JIT=1 python reproduce.py
```

**Expected behavior**

The JIT optimizer should handle the case where no single callable type can be determined for a polymorphic call site, and should either bail out of optimization or emit a safe fallback. It should not crash with an assertion failure.

**Actual behavior**

```
python: ../Python/optimizer_cases.c.h:4307:
  int optimize_uops(...):
  Assertion `probable_callable != NULL' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

**Root cause**

The loop calls `o.method(D)` where `o` alternates between a `Cls` instance, an `int`, and a `str` across iterations. After enough iterations to trigger JIT compilation, `optimize_uops` processes the `CALL` uop for this call site and attempts to determine the most likely callable via `probable_callable`. Because the receiver type is not stable across iterations, `probable_callable` remains `NULL` — but the optimizer unconditionally dereferences it without a null guard, triggering the assertion. The prior `sys.settrace` install-and-clear sequence appears to affect the interpreter's specialization state in a way that causes the JIT to attempt optimization of this polymorphic call site rather than bailing out early.

**Environment**

- CPython debug build
- Crash site: `Python/optimizer_cases.c.h:4307` (`optimize_uops`)
